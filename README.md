**This custom map editor helped me create my game [Edelweiss (open source game)](https://github.com/felixmariotto/Edelweiss)**    
It's absolutely not human-friendly, but I am the only user of this soft. Thanks to it, I created a map constrituted of hundreds of tiles with physic properties (wall on which player can climb, wall on which player fall...). It also helped me position and scale cube elements used for triggering events, emit sound, or simply be another obstacle.
